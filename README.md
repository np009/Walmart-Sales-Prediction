## Walmart sales prediction
The analysis of the Walmart dataset using SAS is designed for the management, sales, and marketing teams at Walmart who rely on data-driven insights to develop effective strategies. The analysis will focus on factors such as holidays, weather, fuel prices, and unemployment rates to understand their impact on Walmart's sales. It is important to present the analysis in a clear and concise manner as the intended audience may not have expertise in statistics. Tables and charts will be used to highlight the most significant findings, which will help the team make informed decisions about sales and marketing strategies, including promotions, pricing adjustments, and staffing changes.

## Project Motivation
This project aims to analyze sales data of 45 Walmart stores using SAS and identify factors, patterns, and trends that impact sales. The goal is to provide valuable insights to improve business decisions, increase revenue, and enhance the customer experience to keep Walmart competitive.

## File Description
This SAS project includes several files that are used for analyzing and visualizing data. The files and their purposes are listed below:

Walmart_Rawdata.csv: This file contains the raw data that will be analyzed using SAS. It includes information on various variables such as customer demographics, purchasing behavior, and product information.

Walmart_Sales.sas: This is the main SAS program file. It includes the code for importing the data from the CSV file, cleaning and transforming the data, conducting statistical analyses, and creating visualizations.

## How to access SAS program

* Ensure that SAS is installed on your computer. If you do not have SAS installed, you can download a free trial version from the SAS website.
* Clone or download the project repository from GitHub to your local machine.
* Open SAS and navigate to the location where you saved the project files.
* Open the sas_program.sas file in SAS. This is the main SAS program file that contains the code for importing, cleaning, and analyzing the data.
* In the SAS program editor, update the file paths in the import code to match the location where you saved the project files.
* Run the SAS program by clicking on the "Run" button or by pressing the "F3" key.
* Once the program has finished running, navigate to the "output" folder to view the results files generated by the program.
* By following these steps, you should be able to access and run the SAS program files included in this project. 
* The initial approach involves importing the dataset file into SAS, which will enable us to review and improve our understanding of the data. This will be accomplished by utilizing the PROC IMPORT procedure.
* Please adjust the file location in proc import accordingly.
## Results
* The approach involves leveraging SAS to ensure the accuracy and reliability of Walmart's sales data. This includes fixing data formats, dealing with missing values, identifying, and addressing outliers, and correcting any possible errors, to ensure the data is accurate and reliable for further analysis.
* Also conduct a comparative analysis of sales performance across different Walmart stores over a specified period, examining trends and patterns to gain insights into how various stores are performing in terms of sales.
* Using SAS to analyze the data that will identify factors that contribute to changes in sales, such as holidays, fuel prices, unemployment rates, consumer price index, and seasonal variations. This analysis will provide Walmart with valuable insights to plan inventory and staffing, among other areas of improvement.
* To effectively communicate the findings and insights to the intended audience, including Walmart management, investors, and stakeholders, which will utilize data visualization tools such as charts and graphs.
